    "At first, I opened and read the tsv files using the command open(file, 'r'(read). After that I created two empty lists called locusgenelist and germplasmlist to fill them with two for loops. The for loop use the command readline to read the lines in order and fill the lists in order using the command .append. The file is a tsv file and for this reason I have used the command line.split(\\t) to shows the code how the elements in a line in the files are separated.\n",
    "Once I filled the lists, I close the files and remove the header line of each list using the command .pop(0) that remove the first element of the list (I have removed the header line).\n",
    "After that, using Python SQL library I filled the tables created in MySQL in problem 2 with the lists (locusgenelist and germplasmlist). To do it I filled the tables with command cursor.executemany and execute the sql line to insert data and the list to fill the values (%s).\n",
